# ArtmapTO
There are a lot of great travel websites and mobile apps available for travellers and people planning a future trip. Those websites and applications cover a wide range of people but fail to fully consider special needs from people with certain interests. Most of travel suggestions and plans based on travel locations or scenarios. People with different interests are not highly targeted by those large websites. Imagine that if my goal was to taste all the delicious foods around the world. Who would recommend my travel plan? If my goal is to travel to the locations of my favourite movies, how should I plan my trip?

We decide to design and create a website solving the pain point for people who love art and museum. Also, for users to have a better immersive experience with this website, we provide VR viewing options for users, using Google Street-view map.

When users open the ArtmapTo website, they can see the introduction of this website and the pictures flow about the Toronto art world. We made four art fields for users in the navigation bar: Museum, Galleries, Art school and Street art. We made the trip arrangements recommendation for every field depends on how long they would like to spend, from 1 - 3 days. They can get the map and the introductions. If they want to check what the place looks like, they can just click the name of the place, and jump into the Google Street-view map, like a virtual gallery.
